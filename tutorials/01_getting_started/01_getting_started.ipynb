    "We begin by importing the modules we need: `Experiment` and `RunSettings`. `RunSettings` is the object used in SmartSim to define what will be run by a given `Model`. `RunSettings` is the most basic way of defining execution parameters, and will be perfect for executing programs launched locally, i.e. directly by the operating system, without a workload manager. We also import `os`, as we will need to setup the directory where the `Model`s will place their output and error files."

We also explicitly set `block=True` (even though it is the default), so that  `Experiment.start` waits until the last `Model` has finished before returning: it will act like a job monitor, letting us know if processes run, complete, or fail."
